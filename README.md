Next steps and considerations
1. Introduction
This document outlines the process of creating an Azure App Service using Terraform, configuring it to deploy a sample .NET application from GitHub, and successfully verifying the deployment.

2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

An active Azure subscription
Terraform installed on your local machine
GitHub account
.NET SDK installed (for creating the sample application)
3. Setting Up Azure Environment
Creating a Resource Group
Launch the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
Create a new Resource Group named tfstate-rg.
Choose a suitable region (e.g., "Central India") for the Resource Group.
Creating a Storage Account for Terraform State
Create a new Storage Account named tfstatestorageaccount within the tfstate-rg Resource Group.
Configure the storage account to use "Standard" tier and "LRS" replication.
4. Terraform Configuration
Configuring main.tf for App Service Plan and App Service
In your Terraform configuration file (main.tf), define the resources for the App Service Plan and App Service.
Use the "Free" tier and size "F1" for the App Service Plan.
Specify the Resource Group name and other necessary details.
Creating a Resource Group using resource_group.tf
Create a file named resource_group.tf.
Define the resource group using the azurerm_resource_group resource.
Set the name and location of the resource group.
Setting Up Backend Configuration in backend.tf
Create a file named backend.tf.
Configure the Terraform backend to use the previously created storage account for storing the state.
Set the resource group name, storage account name, container name, and state file name.
5. Azure App Service Setup
Defining the Azure App Service Plan in Terraform
In your Terraform configuration (main.tf), define the Azure App Service Plan using azurerm_app_service_plan resource.
Use the previously created Resource Group and configure the "Free" tier and size "F1".
Creating an Azure App Service
Define the Azure App Service using the azurerm_app_service resource in your Terraform configuration.
Set the Resource Group, App Service Plan, and other necessary details.
6. GitHub Deployment Setup
Configuring GitHub Repository for Deployment
Log in to your GitHub account.
Create or select a repository for your .NET application.
Ensure that the application code is in the repository.
Adding GitHub as a Deployment Source in Azure App Service
Go to the Azure Portal.
Navigate to the created App Service.
Open the "Deployment Center" section.
Choose GitHub as the source and provide repository details.
Configure GitHub Actions for deployment.
7. Deployment and Verification
Creating a .NET Sample Application
Create a simple .NET application that prints "Welcome to 2023" on the screen.
Push the application code to your GitHub repository.
Configuring Deployment Settings
In the App Service's Deployment Center, configure build and runtime settings.
Choose "GitHub Actions" as the build provider and "dotnet7" as the runtime.
Initiating Deployment in GitHub Actions
Check your GitHub repository for the automatically created GitHub Actions workflow.
Trigger the workflow to initiate the deployment.
Verifying the Deployed Application
Once the deployment is successful, access the deployed application using the App Service URL.
Verify that the application displays "Welcome to 2023."
8. Conclusion
In this guide, you successfully created an Azure App Service using Terraform, integrated it with GitHub for automated deployment, and verified the deployment of a sample .NET application. This demonstrates the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and the seamless integration between Azure services and DevOps practices.

Feel free to follow this outline and add relevant screenshots or snapshots at each step to create a comprehensive documentation of your process. Adapt the document to your own writing style and preferences. This will serve as a valuable reference for yourself and others who might need to perform similar tasks.
